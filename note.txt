QA log (auto-updated)

Scope completed today:
- Cart coupons: apply/remove fixed, AJAX on cart page for qty/update/remove.
- Cart UX: product grid and product detail “Add to Cart” → “Carted (N items)” with +/- (no reload); header count live.
- Payment gateways: Stripe/PayPal with admin config, enable/disable, test; settings/logs tables.
- Currency: model + admin CRUD (set default/toggle), @currency directive, header switcher.
- Newsletter: subscribers/settings (frontend forms + admin list/settings).
- OTP: Email/SMS OTP with admin OTP Settings (enable, length, TTL, attempts, SMS gateway + API fields) and UI pages.
- Email Settings: admin-managed SMTP that reconfigures mail at runtime.
- Admin UI: Bootstrap 5 navbar/cards, sidebar links added.

Quick QA checklist (remaining to spot-check):
1) Payment — create/update gateway config; run “Test Connection”.
2) Currencies — add/edit/delete/toggle/default; price formatting across pages.
3) Newsletter — subscribe (home/footer), status toggle/remove in admin.
4) OTP — request/verify email and SMS; respect admin settings.
5) Checkout — place order end-to-end; order shows in admin/user orders.
